1. Make the photo centered in the middle on the left side in a border of 1920x1080 maybe; idea is to keep it the same size but not stretch the image;
keep it the original size

2. Add an account (only one master account for me) option so I can add and delete pictures and descriptions (edit descriptions too) from the website itself.

3. Add a feature to control the videos - scrubbing, volume, and no fullscreen option when you click the image. Have music autoplay when you scroll to it and have it in
the majority of the screen - keep the time of the video and don't replay unless you refresh the page. You can scrub to the beginning

4. That's it.
